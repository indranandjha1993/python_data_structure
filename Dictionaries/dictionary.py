 Declaring dictionary

 In Dictionary each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by
 commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just
 two curly braces, like this âˆ’ {}.

 Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type,
 but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
